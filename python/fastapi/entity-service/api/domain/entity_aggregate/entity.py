    A domain entity has a business domain meaning outside of a given service's
    bounded context. It has identity which does not change over time, context,
    or when its attributes change.

    A simple example of a domain entity is a "User" or "Customer" object.
    This entity represents a person, which can change names, addresses, roles,
    or relationships, and it is still the same entity.
    Different contexts will need to use and model different attributes of User/Customer.
    A User domain service may maintain the core view of all User entity attributes,
    while an Order domain service may need just the credit card info and shipping addresses.
